what is a mini-article?

A mini-article has a couple of characteristics: 
- it’s short
- it’s simple
- it generally only has sections (no subsections)

- when working with your editor, it should be much easier to get these kinds of simple articles right from the start, or at the most with a bit of help, but certainly not a lot of feedback will be needed


- here are a few examples of live mini-articles (not on baeldung.com):

converting articles into mini-articles and mini-articles into articles

Keep in mind that any article that’s close to 500 words should be converted into a mini-article. 
Also, any mini-article that gets close to 750 words should be converted into a full article.
